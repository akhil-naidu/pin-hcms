# Getting Started

1. `pnpm i`
2. `pnpm generate:types`
3. `pnpm dev`

# Required Collections

1. pages
2. blogs

# Basic Idea

Both the collections we create should have the idea of:

1. Blocks in every page and blog
2. Dynamic Generation using the render which we already use in `pin-contentql`
3. Clear documentation on how to create blocks in frontend and backend.
